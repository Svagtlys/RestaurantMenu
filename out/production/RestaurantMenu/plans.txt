The menu consists of several menu items
Each menu item has a price, description, and category (appetizer, main course, or dessert)
It should be possible to display whether a menu item is new or not
The app should know when the menu was last updated, so visitors can see that the restaurant is constantly changing and adding exciting new items

Class MenuItem
    String name, description, category
    double price
    boolean isNewItem
    LocalDate dateCreated

    MenuItem(name, description, category, price) //sets dateCreated and isNewItem itself

    public getters, private setters
    public setPrice(double newPrice)
    public setIsNewItem(LocalDate currentDate) //checks if current date is far enough from dateCreated, then sets isNewItem accordingly

Class Menu
    Date lastUpdated
    HashMap<String, MenuItem> menu- Name of item, MenuItem object

    void addItem(name, description, category, price) //Will change lastUpdated

    void listItems() //Will print out keys in menu

    void listNewItems() //Will update which items are new and then print out new items

    void removeItem(name) //Removes related item from menu

    void listLastUpdated() //Will print out the date that the menu was last updated
