The menu consists of several menu items
Each menu item has a price, description, and category (appetizer, main course, or dessert)
It should be possible to display whether a menu item is new or not
The app should know when the menu was last updated, so visitors can see that the restaurant is constantly changing and adding exciting new items

Class MenuItem
    String name, description, category
    double price
    boolean isNewItem
    LocalDate dateCreated

    MenuItem(name, description, category, price) //sets dateCreated and isNewItem itself

    public getters, private setters
    public setPrice(double newPrice)
    public setIsNewItem(LocalDate currentDate) //checks if current date is far enough from dateCreated, then sets isNewItem accordingly

    public String toString() //Turns MenuItem data into a string
    public boolean equals(Object toCompare) //Checks for name equality

Class Menu
    Date lastUpdated
    HashMap<String, MenuItem> menu- Name of item, MenuItem object

    public void addItem(name, description, category, price) //adds item and updates date

    public void removeItem(name) //Removes item from menu (if applicable), then updates date if removal successful

    private boolean isNewItem(MenuItem item) //helper method to determine if item was added recently

    public void listNewItems() //Will call isNewItem() and then print out new items

    public void listLastUpdated() //Will list the date the menu was last updated

    public void listItems() //Will print out menuItem toStrings

    public void listItem(String item) //will print out single menuItem toString, if in menu







    void listLastUpdated() //Will print out the date that the menu was last updated
